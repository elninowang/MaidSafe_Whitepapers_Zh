版本 1.4

## MaidSafe.net宣布项目SAFE到社区 ##

#### 1.	介绍

Existing Internet infrastructure is increasingly unable to cope with the demands placed on it by over [2.4 billion](http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats.htm) connected people, a number that is predicted to grow to [3.6 billion](http://newsroom.cisco.com/release/1197391/) by 2017. Today's architecture, where central intermediaries (servers) store and provide access to data is expensive and inefficient. Data centres use between [1.1% and 1.5%](http://www.koomey.com/post/8323374335) of the world's electricity (growing at 60% per annum) and represent significant expenditure for data centre owners, providers and businesses, who all have to pay to host user data and maintain the infrastructure. Security of user data has proven to be nearly impossible in today's networks with almost weekly reports of ID and password thefts.

现有的互联网基础设施越来越难以应付超过[24亿](http://newsroom.cisco.com/release/1197391/)的互联网用户的需求，这个数字预计将增长到[36亿](http://newsroom.cisco.com/release/1197391/)在2017年。今天的架构中，中央中介（服务器）存储并提供对数据的访问是昂贵和低效的。 数据中心使用世界电力（每年增长60％）的[1.1％和1.5％](http://www.koomey.com/post/8323374335) 之间的数据中心所有者，供应商和企业 ，他们都必须付费才能托管用户数据并维护基础架构。 在今天的网络中，用户数据的安全已经被证明几乎不可能，几乎每周都有ID和密码盗窃的报道。
 
To overcome these challenges a fresh approach is required, a solution that removes these inordinately expensive central points of failure, data leakage and bottlenecks. By developing a fully decentralised replacement for all Internet based services, Secure Access For Everyone (SAFE) will ensure the decentralised Internet is a reality, enabling:

为了克服这些挑战，需要采取全新的方法，这种解决方案可以消除这些非常昂贵的中心故障点，数据泄漏和瓶颈。 通过为所有基于互联网的服务开发完全分散的替代品，人人安全访问的（SAFE）将确保分散式互联网成为现实，从而实现：

- Autonomous handling of structured and unstructured data types
- Private and secure communications
- Data shared at the filesystem level worldwide, no need for http, smtp, ftp etc.
- Highly encrypted and private data at rest and in transit
- The ability for people to self-authenticate onto the network and join anonymously 
- A network resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks or IP address identification
- A network that requires no administrators or human intervention of any kind
- No requirement for forward planning using infrastructure that automatically configures around its users in real-time (no data centres)
- A highly usable and free API that enables a plethora of developers to create the next wave of secure applications not currently possible with today's centralised architecture
- An underlying crypto currency called safecoin that will incentivise all actors in this ecosystem
>
- 自主处理结构化和非结构化数据类型
- 私密和安全的通信
- 在全球文件系统级共享数据，不需要http，smtp，ftp等。
- 高度加密和在休息和运输中的私人数据
- 人们在网络上进行自我认证并匿名加入的能力
- 抵抗中间人攻击或IP地址识别的网络
- 不需要任何管理员或人为干预的网络
- 无需使用基础架构进行前瞻性规划，实时自动配置其用户（无数据中心）
- 一种高度可用且免费的API，使众多开发人员能够利用当今集中式体系结构创建当前不可能实现的下一波安全应用程序
- 一种名为safecoin的潜在加密货币，可激励此生态系统中的所有参与者

SAFE is the culmination of 8 years of effort by MaidSafe.net and the continued and growing number of project developers. These developers will include MaidSafe.net and many other decentralised Internet application developers. Please see http://maidsafe.net for an introduction to the technology as well as https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/wiki for access to project documentation and code. 

SAFE是MaidSafe.net和持续不断增加的项目开发人员8年努力的结晶。 这些开发人员将包括MaidSafe.net和许多其他分散的互联网应用程序开发人员。 请参阅 http://maidsafe.net 获取技术介绍，以及 https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/wiki 获取项目文档和代码。

The inclusion of a [crypto currency](https://www.google.com/patents/US20100064354) is not new to the maidsafe core design. It is a logical step included in the initial design many years ago (2006). Importantly, **this proposal creates no founders pool or shares** but, incentivises funders, developers, users and satisfies existing investors in MaidSafe. This allows MaidSafe to clearly show this network truly belongs to us all and in perpetuity. It is a hugely important step to ensure the network is widely used and worked on by many hundreds of developers who can see the potential for a fully secured, unowned and decentralised Internet. The proposed crowd sale will seed the network, expand the developer base worldwide and push the whole proposition to the wider community in a manner that is extremely clear and logical.

包含 [加密货币](https://www.google.com/patents/US20100064354) 对maidsafe核心设计来说并不陌生。 这是多年前（2006年）最初设计中的一个合乎逻辑的步骤。 重要的是，**这个提案并没有创建创建者池或股票**，但是激励了资助者，开发者，用户并满足了MaidSafe中的现有投资者。 这使得MaidSafe能够清楚地显示这个网络真正属于我们，并且永久属于我们。 这是确保网络得到数百名开发人员广泛使用和开发的非常重要的一步，这些开发人员可以看到完全安全，无主权和分散的互联网的潜力。 拟议的人群出售将使网络成熟，扩大全球开发者基础，并以非常明确和合乎逻辑的方式将整个主题推广到更广泛的社区。

###### MaidSafe简史

Formed in February 2006 with the intent to decentralise the Internet, the  14-strong team is based in Troon, Scotland. To reach this project stage, MaidSafe has taken investment from close friends and family, as well as supporters and Angel Investors.  Further backing and supporters are required to push the platform out to the world and to incentivise network adoption. 

该组织于2006年2月成立，旨在下放互联网，这个14人的团队位于苏格兰的特伦。 为了进入这个项目阶段，MaidSafe已经接受了亲密朋友和家人以及支持者和天使投资人的投资。 需要进一步的支持和支持者将该平台推向世界并激励网络的普及。
 
It is also worth noting that the founder allocated all of his shares in MaidSafe to an employee share scheme (around 28%) and almost 50% of the business to a not for profit foundation. The [MaidSafe Foundation](http://www.maidsafefoundation.org/) will be a key player in this proposal and exists to ensure fair distribution of wealth, while helping to foster education and innovation.  Based in Scotland, the laws and regulations surrounding such organisations ensure there can be no profit motive for trustees or members of the Foundation. This is an important model for managing many aspects of a decentralised project such as SAFE.

同样值得注意的是，创始人将所有MaidSafe股票分配给员工股份计划（约28％）和几乎50％的业务，以非营利为基础。 [MaidSafe Foundation](http://www.maidsafefoundation.org/) 将成为这一提案中的关键角色，其目的在于确保公平分配财富，同时帮助促进教育和创新。 基于苏格兰，围绕这些组织的法律和法规确保受托人或基金会成员不会有利润动机。 这是管理SAFE等分散项目许多方面的重要模式。

##### 2. Project Status 项目状态

At this time, MaidSafe has completed the foundation libraries and associated code. The API is being finalised in conjunction with application developers to ensure ease of use and this is being supplemented by examples and demonstrations. The network is preparing to go into wide scale testing and MaidSafe are hoping to implement this during the announcement of the funding round. At present, developers can download and run networks for test purposes.

目前，MaidSafe已经完成了基础库和相关代码。 该API正在与应用程序开发人员一起确定，以确保易用性，并通过示例和演示进行补充。 该网络正在准备进行大规模测试，MaidSafe希望在资金轮公布期间实施这一计划。 目前，开发人员可以下载并运行网络以进行测试。

Full public launch of the network will take place in the very near future. Earning capabilities will be added to nodes over a period of several weeks after the initial network testing is carried out and any issues and critical bugs are resolved.  MaidSafe will be hosting weekly public [Google Hangouts](http://www.google.com/hangouts/) over this period to answer any questions and assist application developers first hand.

网络的全面公开发布将在不久的将来进行。 在进行初始网络测试并解决任何问题和严重错误后的几周内，将会为节点添加收益功能。 MaidSafe将在此期间每周公开[Google环聊](http://www.google.com/hangouts/)，以回答任何问题并协助应用程序开发人员。


##### 3. Proof Of Resource 资源证明

In many cryptocurrencies and decentralised networks a proof of something is required to allow the network to validate actions or services via a mathematically verifiable mechanism. In bitcoin this is achieved by a proof of work. This is essentially a hashing technique that requires significant (and growing) computer power to achieve. This technique allows bitcoin to confirm transactions and reward 'miners' with a block of coins randomly. 

在许多加密货币和分散网络中，需要证明某些东西以允许网络通过数学上可验证的机制来验证动作或服务。 在比特币中，这是通过工作量证明来实现的。 这本质上是一种哈希技术，需要大量（并且不断增长）的计算机能力才能实现。 该技术允许比特币确认交易并随机用一块币奖励“矿工”。

The SAFE network can validate nodes and their value to the network in a very accurate and cryptographically secure manner. The SAFE project will use this to create a **proof of resource** (see Appendix) which has some significant advantages. The resource in question is a computer's ability to store data chunks, which depends on CPU speed, bandwidth, disk space and on-line time, amongst others. This allows the proof to be a useful, measurable and an immediately verifiable entity. Proof of resource is a very efficient mechanism as its cost is very minimal.

SAFE网络可以以非常准确和密码安全的方式验证节点及其对网络的价值。 国家外汇管理局项目将使用它来创建**资源证明**（见附录），其具有一些显着的优点。 有问题的资源是计算机存储数据块的能力，这取决于CPU速度，带宽，磁盘空间和在线时间等。 这使得证明是一个有用的，可衡量的和可立即验证的实体。 资源证明是一个非常有效的机制，因为它的成本非常低。

Additionally, as a fully decentralised network, the SAFE approach allows transactions to be made and confirmed at network speed (under a second in some cases). This is due to a distributed Transaction Manager as opposed to a blockchain. In the SAFE network, a transaction management system can be linked or not. Bitcoin uses a linked blockchain (the chain term) that allows traversal of all transactions from the network start. SAFE has chosen an unlinked approach to the blockchain. Each user's account information is held by the group of nodes closest to it (according to the XOR address distance). The Transaction Manager only holds a temporary receipt object during the transaction procedure among users. This temporary receipt can be stored permanently allowing proof of the transaction to be maintained or destroyed immediately after the transaction is completed, leaving no trace on the network. In addition to allowing instant transfers of coins, this mechanism also allows an escrow model (a third party acts as moderator to resolve the payment dispute). This escrow mechanism is a core component of the currency.

此外，作为一个完全分散的网络，SAFE方法允许以网络速度进行交易（在某些情况下不超过一秒）。这是由于分布式事务管理器而不是区块链。在SAFE网络中，交易管理系统可以连接或不连接。比特币使用链接区块链（链式术语），允许从网络开始遍历所有交易。国家外汇管理局选择了与区块链无关的方法。每个用户的帐户信息由最靠近它的节点组保存（根据异或地址距离）。事务管理器仅在用户之间的事务处理过程中保存临时收货对象。该临时收据可永久存储，以便在交易完成后立即维护或销毁交易证明，而不会在网络上留下任何痕迹。除了允许即时转移币外，该机制还允许托管模式（第三方担任主持人以解决付款争议）。这种托管机制是货币的核心组成部分。

##### 4. Safecoin
 
For technical implementation details see the Appendix. 

有关技术实施细节，请参阅附录。

History has demonstrated that having the most cutting-edge technology does not in itself guarantee wide scale use.  To ensure the SAFE network is fully and efficiently utilised, a token-based scheme is proposed where all stakeholder groups have the ability to earn these tokens (safecoins) in a manner that is both fair and equitable.

历史证明，拥有最尖端的技术本身并不能保证广泛的使用。 为确保安全网络得到充分有效利用，提出了一种基于Token的方案，其中所有利益相关者群体都有能力以公平和公平的方式获得这些代币（Safecoin）。

Safecoin (http://www.safecoin.io) may be earned, traded or purchased. The whole SAFE network is configured and designed to incentivise all parts of the community. The incentivisation is a critical component of a fully decentralised Internet. The MaidSafe code base is a part of this process, other application developers will add to this and be incentivised, users will be rewarded with safecoin for allowing their computer to be part of the network and funders who act as the catalyst will be able to buy safecoin (via intermediary MaidSafeCoin) directly, prior to the full network launch. This will allow sufficient resource to be made available to launch the network worldwide and application developers to release apps of significant value to us all. This project is simply the beginning of a new Internet, one that we all own and nobody controls, this is the "Internet sans frontieres!"

Safecoin (http://www.safecoin.io) 可能会被赚取，交易或购买。 整个SAFE网络的配置和设计都是为了激励社区的所有部分。 激励是完全分散的互联网的关键组成部分。 MaidSafe代码库是这个过程的一部分，其他应用程序开发者将增加这一点，并被激励，用户将被奖励与SafeCoin，让他们的电脑成为网络的一部分，作为催化剂的供资者将能够购买 在完整的网络发布之前，直接通过中间商MaidSafeCoin进行SafeCoin。 这将使足够的资源可用于启动全球网络和应用程序开发人员向我们所有人发布具有重要价值的应用程序。 这个项目只是一个新的互联网的开始，我们都拥有并且没有人控制这个互联网，这就是“互联网无敌”！

In essence, safecoin is a fair and transparent way of incentivising developers, backers and end users to use SAFE.  As users trade their proof of resource, they are still earning safecoin as they are continuing to provide valuable network resources.  Application developers can now use safecoin as their revenue model, enabling them to concentrate on providing amazing applications and not worry about revenue models and streams. Supporters can help to back a network that is focussed on providing common good while achieving returns that reward their willingness to take financial risk.

实质上，safecoin是激励开发商，支持者和最终用户使用SAFE的公平和透明的方式。 随着用户交换他们的资源证明，他们仍在继续提供宝贵的网络资源，因此他们仍然在赚钱。 应用程序开发人员现在可以使用safecoin作为他们的收入模型，使他们能够专注于提供令人惊叹的应用程序，而不用担心收入模型和流。 支持者可以帮助支持注重提供公共利益的网络，同时实现回报，奖励他们承担财务风险的意愿。

It is proposed that safecoin will have a predictable cap (2<sup>32</sup>) with a value that is determined solely by the market. Safecoin will be a virtual currency with SAFE being used to complete transactions.

建议safecoin有一个可预测的上限 (2<sup>32</sup>)，其价值完全由市场决定。 Safecoin将成为SAFE用于完成交易的虚拟货币。

##### 5. 项目建议

Many of today's centralised systems use advertising to monetise their existence, or actually charge for resources that are in fact exponentially decreasing in value (CPU, disk space, bandwidth, etc.).  MaidSafe proposes an approach that should not only make resources cheaper, but should also provide a crypto currency (safecoin) that will increase in value, facilitating exchange both on and off the SAFE network.

今天的许多中央系统使用广告来货币化它们的存在，或者实际上为实际上呈指数级下降的资源（CPU，磁盘空间，带宽等）收取费用。 MaidSafe提出了一种方法，该方法不仅应该使资源更便宜，而且还应该提供价值增加的加密货币（Safecoin），促进SAFE网络上下的交换。
 
This paper demonstrates the creation of a fixed number of coins over time 2<sup>32</sup> (~4 billion), which can be further subdivided to facilitate trading. This approach increases reuse of the coins, further incentivising miners. This proof of resource will represent disk space, CPU and bandwidth involved in storing shards of information. These resources will increase over time, creating a much desired increasing value for safecoin holders, while delivering exponential decreases in the cost of resources. The proof of resource algorithm will over time account for additional resources, such as proof of bandwidth, proof of CPU processing, etc.

这篇论文演示了随着时间的推移创建固定数量的币 2<sup>32</sup>（〜40亿），这可以进一步细分，以促进贸易。 这种方法增加了币的重复使用，进一步激励了矿工。 资源证明将代表存储信息碎片时涉及的磁盘空间，CPU和带宽。 随着时间的推移，这些资源将会增加，从而为Safecoin持有者创造一个非常理想的增长价值，同时实现资源成本的指数降低。 随着时间的推移，资源算法证明会考虑额外资源，如带宽证明，CPU处理证明等。

![Resources Graph](https://raw.github.com/maidsafe/Whitepapers/master/resources/resources_graph.png)

In essence, this proposal will ensure computing resources are shared amongst all users at the lowest possible cost.  MaidSafe believes this approach will provide the most cost-effective and efficient computing platform in the world, realising the company’s vision of an Internet for everyone, free from spying, privacy erosion and data loss.

实质上，该提议将确保计算资源以尽可能最低的成本在所有用户之间共享。 MaidSafe相信这种方法将提供世界上最具成本效益和最高效的计算平台，实现公司为每个人提供互联网的愿景，不受间谍，隐私侵蚀和数据丢失的影响。

#### 6. 激励和币分配
 
The SAFE network is fully inclusive and enables everyone to get involved and become a part of the project, whether a supporter, end user, backer or developer.

SAFE网络是完全包容性的，无论是支持者，最终用户，支持者还是开发者，都可以让每个人都参与并成为项目的一部分。

##### 终端用户
 
As end users join the SAFE network anonymously, they will start a vault (a data storage and management location).  This vault will add itself automatically to the network and start providing resources. These vaults require no setup and administration, they are a simple download and install.  The network is designed to self-manage these resources and reward these 'farmers'(vault owners) accordingly in a random fashion, uniformly distributed across the network, thereby securing the network’s data.

随着终端用户匿名加入SAFE网络，他们将启动一个Vault（数据存储和管理位置）。 该保管库将自动添加到网络并开始提供资源。 这些保管库不需要安装和管理，它们是简单的下载和安装。 该网络旨在对这些资源进行自我管理，并以随机方式相应奖励这些“农民”（金库所有者），统一分布在整个网络中，从而保护网络数据。

The earning speed is based on the storage space contributed to and verified by the network.  For details of the calculation, please see Appendix ‘Token System on MaidSafe Network’.  Note the developer and crowd sale lines are obscured by the IP pool.

收入速度基于网络贡献和验证的存储空间。 有关计算的详细信息，请参阅附录'MaidSafe Network上的Token系统'。 请注意，开发人员和人群销售热线被IP池遮盖。


![End User Graph](https://raw.github.com/maidsafe/Whitepapers/master/resources/end_users.png)

If people were to try and game the system by providing farmers to store data and then switch them off, they will simply remove their ability to earn.  At some time in the future it is envisaged the network will be able to detect such data and remove it from the network.  In the meantime, this kind of attack is costly to the perpetrators as their earning potential is adversely affected by their actions.  This strategy also allows the network to arbitrate and manage resources mathematically and reduces the effects of the [tragedy of the commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) type deficiencies, requiring users to provide resources in an honest manner.

如果人们试图通过为农民存储数据然后关闭系统而对系统进行游戏，他们将会简单地消除他们的赚钱能力。 在未来的某个时间，预计网络将能够检测这些数据并将其从网络中移除。 与此同时，这种袭击对肇事者来说代价昂贵，因为他们的收入潜力受到他们行为的不利影响。 该策略还允许网络以数学方式仲裁和管理资源，并减少[公共悲剧](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) 类型缺陷的影响，要求用户以诚实的方式提供资源 方式。

Unlike many currencies, the distribution of safecoin is backed by information. This information represents the world’s data and grows exponentially. Unlike gold, which only increases at circa 1.5% per annum, the quantity of safecoin will initially burgeon. This is akin to the California gold rush, where the quantity of gold grew quickly with enthusiastic miners. In safecoin this is mirrored by the network building to the stage where it is protecting all of the world’s data. During that time the mining frequency will be exponentially decreasing.

与许多货币不同，Safecoin的分配由信息支持。这些信息代表了世界的数据并呈指数增长。与每年仅增长1.5％的黄金不同，SafeCoin的数量最初会逐渐增加。这与加利福尼亚淘金热类似，黄金的数量与热心的矿工迅速增长。在SafeCoin中，网络建设将其反映到保护全球所有数据的阶段。在此期间，采矿频率将呈指数级下降。

When all of the world’s data is secured, mining will naturally slow to a pace that just keeps up with the fungibility of the whole system and the increased resources under it's protection. This will be possible as people trade safecoin for network resources. These resources are initially data, but will likely grow to be bandwidth (to allow satellite and mesh networks) and processing power (for decentralised mass calculation work) amongst others. 

当所有的世界数据都得到保证时，采矿速度自然会放慢，只能跟上整个系统的可替代性以及在其保护下的资源增加。随着人们为网络资源交易SafeCoin，这将是可能的。这些资源最初是数据，但可能会增长为带宽（以允许卫星和网状网络）和处理能力（用于分散式质量计算工作）等等。

The number of resources will be calculated by the network dynamically and in perpetuity. The value of individual safecoin will be market determined and this is an important notion. The number of coins in circulation is network led and the individual value is market driven. As people trade safecoin for goods and services this market value will be realised.  

资源数量将由网络动态且永久地计算。 个人Safecoin的价值将由市场决定，这是一个重要的概念。 流通中的币数量由网络引导，个人价值由市场驱动。 由于人们为商品和服务交易SafeCoin，这个市场价值将会实现。

MaidSafe's figures forecast an estimated mining rate over time, this forecast is completely dependent on a number of assumptions including; speed of network adoption and the amount of data stored…etc. MaidSafe does not see this as an obstacle, rather a huge opportunity. Competing in today’s market using the SAFE proposition is an enormous advantage to developers (many of which are described in this paper) and to do so in an open network which is owned by no one is very compelling.

MaidSafe的数据预测了随着时间的推移估计的采矿率，这个预测完全取决于一些假设，包括： 网络采用的速度和存储的数据量等。 MaidSafe并不认为这是一个障碍，而是一个巨大的机会。 在今天的市场上使用SAFE命题进行竞争对开发人员来说是一个巨大的优势（本文中描述了其中的许多优点），并且在没有人拥有的开放式网络中这样做是非常有吸引力的。

##### Backers 支持者
 
To allow distributed ownership of the network, MaidSafe will allocate 30% of the tokens on day 1.  The coins allocated are fungible, particularly in the form of resources as backers reach their required returns or simply trade the coins.  This allocation of safecoin will allow two separate entities to be rewarded:

为了允许分布式网络的所有权，MaidSafe将在第一天分配30％的代币。分配的代币是可替代的，特别是当资助者达到其要求的回报或简单地交易币时的资源形式。 Safecoin的这种分配将允许两个独立的实体得到奖励：

###### a: Current MaidSafe investors/shareholders. 当前MaidSafe保投资者/股东。

The current MaidSafe investors have invested for the past 8 years with complete faith and a strong desire to make a difference.  These investors have been the very reason the technology is now developed and this proposal possible.  Five percent of the safecoin issue will be laid aside for these investors and as safecoin is increasing in value, current investors will be able to swap their shareholding in MaidSafe.net for the coins.   **The coins will be held by the MaidSafe Foundation for issuance at the request of each shareholder.** The safecoin here will be allocated at the point miners are introduced onto the network.

目前的MaidSafe投资者在过去的8年中投入了巨大的信心和强烈的追求。 这些投资者一直是该技术现在正在发展的原因，并且这个提议也是可能的。 SafeCoin问题的5％将被搁置给这些投资者，并且随着SafeCoin的价值不断增加，目前的投资者将能够在MaidSafe.net中换取他们在币中的股权。 **这些币将由MaidSafe基金会根据每个股东的要求进行发行。**这里的SafeCoin将在矿工被引入网络的时候分配。
 
This allows investors to be rewarded for their help over the years and will also allow MaidSafe equity to return to being owned completely by the Foundation.  This approach will ensure that MaidSafe as a company is not in charge of the SAFE network and shareholders are treated with the respect they deserve.  When they are allocated safecoin they can hold these as any backer will today. 

这使得投资者多年来可以得到他们的帮助，并且还可以让MaidSafe的股权回归基金会全部所有。 这种做法将确保MaidSafe作为一家公司不负责安全网络，股东得到应有的尊重。 当他们被分配safecoin时，他们可以像今天的任何支持者一样持有这些。
 
###### b: Crowd Sale Participants 人群销售参与者
A crowd sale will enable everyone worldwide to seed and be a part of the SAFE project.  This 
will last until MaidSafeCoin are sold out (circa $8million). If the all coins are not sold the event will end after 30 days. The crowd sale will enable a direct purchase up to ten percent of MaidSafeCoin. It is anticipated that soon after the crowd sale commences, MaidSafeCoin will be listed on exchanges and will be tradable, right up to the release of safecoin. 

出售人群将使全球每个人都能种子并成为国家外汇管理局项目的一部分。 这个
将持续到MaidSafeCoin售罄（大约800万美元）。 如果所有币都没有售出，事件将在30天后结束。 出售人群将直接购买MaidSafeCoin的百分之十。 预计在大众销售开始后不久，MaidSafeCoin将在交易所上市，并可以进行交易，直至发行Safecoin。

These crowd sale participants will be buying MaidSafeCoin, an intermediary coin that will be swapped on a 1:1 ratio for safecoin once the full SAFE network is launched. Purchases will be recorded in the bitcoin blockchain via the Master protocol suite. MaidSafe will be running a test net initially and will potentially need to bring the network up and down during testing. An intermediary coin is required as coins may be destroyed from time to time as the network is restarted

这些人群销售参与者将购买MaidSafeCoin，这是一个中间币，一旦全面的SAFE网络启动，将以1:1的比例兑换Safecoin。 采购将通过主协议套件记录在比特币区块链中。 MaidSafe最初将运行一个测试网络，并且可能需要在测试期间使网络上下运行。 中继币是必需的，因为随着网络重新启动，币可能不时被销毁

Particpants will be able to purchase MaidSafeCoins using either bitcoin or mastercoin with payments being made via a website: BuySafeCoins.com to the MaidSafe Foundations exodus address. This address will be published on both the crowd sale website, MaidSafe's own site and also the SAFE network site (www.safecoin.io) prior to the commencement of the crowd sale. Once funds have been received MaidSafeCoins will be automatically generated and will be sent to participants mastercoin wallet. If a participant does not already have one the wallets can be downloaded for free from: http://www.mastercoinwallets.org/. At present only Windows wallets are available, however a web wallet will be available soon.

参与者可以使用比特币或Mastercoin购买MaidSafeCoins，并通过网站进行付款：BuySafeCoins.com到MaidSafe Foundations exodus地址。 该地址将在大众销售网站，MaidSafe自己的网站以及SAFE网站（www.safecoin.io）上发布，然后开始出售人群。 一旦收到资金，MaidSafeCoins将自动生成并发送给参与者mastercoin钱包。 如果参与者还没有一个钱包可以从http://www.mastercoinwallets.org/免费下载。 目前只有Windows钱包可用，但网络钱包即将推出。

The MaidSafe coins purchased will be credited as safecoins to the participants safecoin wallets as soon as the full network is launched and farmers appear online. This allows immediate benefit to the project and will demonstrate the desire of all backers to decentralise the Internet, enabling a plethora of new and exciting companies to emerge and provide true value at minimal cost.

购买MaidSafe币后，只要启动完整网络并让农民上网，就会将其作为SafeCoin存入参与者的电子钱包。 这使项目立即受益，并表现出所有支持者分散互联网的愿望，使众多令人兴奋的新公司崭露头角，并以最低的成本提供真正的价值。

Funds raised from this round will be held by the MaidSafe Foundation and will be utilised to house the MaidSafe core team and provide financial assistance for a period of three years. It is assumed that after three years, the core MaidSafe team will have grown significantly and introduced further innovations into the space. There is no founders pool and this is a very important aspect of this project. No team should be rewarded by safecoin who have not provided value in some respect.

本轮募集的资金将由MaidSafe基金会持有，并将用于安置MaidSafe核心团队并提供为期三年的财务援助。 据推测，三年后，MaidSafe核心团队将大幅增长，并将进一步的创新引入该领域。 没有创始人池，这是这个项目的一个非常重要的方面。 没有团队应该由在某些方面没有提供价值的SafeCoin给予奖励。

##### Developers 开发者
 
MaidSafe proposes to reward developers in 2 ways.  Firstly, safecoin can be earned by contributing bug fixes and code that are accepted into the master branch of the SAFE codebase.  Secondly, developers that create apps that do not charge end users and are of benefit to the community will also be rewarded.  The issuance mechanism for both groups will come via the MaidSafe Foundation. MaidSafe the company will also generate coins by providing P.O.R when they seed the network with several hundred nodes during final platform testing.  This seeding stage will be public and others are welcome to contribute resources.  It should be acknowledged that until the network is declared ‘ready for general use’ that the coins may be destroyed from time to time and the network restarted.  There will be no private or hidden seeding of the network and announcements will be made at a minimum via the MaidSafe [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/maidsafe-development) during these events.

MaidSafe建议以两种方式奖励开发人员。首先，可以通过提供错误修复和代码接受到SAFE代码库的主分支来获得Safecoin。其次，创建不向最终用户收费并且对社区有利的应用程序的开发人员也将获得奖励。这两个团体的发行机制将通过MaidSafe基金会。 MaidSafe公司还将通过提供P.O.R产生币，当他们在最终的平台测试期间为数百个节点播种网络时。这个播种阶段将公开，欢迎其他人提供资源。应该承认，在网络宣布“准备好可以一般使用”之前，币可能会不时被销毁，并且网络重新启动。在这些活动中，不会有隐私或隐藏的网络播报，并且通过MaidSafe [邮件列表](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/maidsafe-development)至少会发布通告。

15% of all safecoin earned will be allocated to the developer pool.  This will ensure the developer community is highly motivated and rewarded for providing free-to-use applications and improvements to the underlying codebase that utilise safecoin as their revenue model. It is possible that 10% of these coins maybe recycled if a an idea of automated developer awards comes to fruition.

所有safecoin的15％将被分配给开发人员池。这将确保开发人员社区具有高度的积极性和回报，因为他们提供免费使用的应用程序和对使用safecoin作为其收入模型的底层代码库的改进。如果一个自动化开发人员奖项的想法能够实现，那么有可能10％的这些币可能会被回收。

5% of the developer pool coins will be given to the core developement team. Without their hard work and dedication the SAFE network would simply not have been possible. A further $100k of safecoin will be allocated from the developer pool to those who gave their time and commitment to develop this white paper and for early project coordination. Without the efforts and expertise of these individuals this paper would not be as comprehensive and would have taken far longer to produce.

5％的开发商池币将交给核心开发团队。 没有他们的辛勤工作和奉献精神，SAFE网络根本就不可能实现。 从开发人员池中还会分配到10万美元的safecoin给那些花时间和承诺来开发本白皮书和早期项目协调的人。 如果没有这些人的努力和专业知识，这篇论文就不会那么全面，而且花费的时间也会更长。
 
It is proposed that code commits and third party projects be chosen by polling the MaidSafe developer mailing list and payments will be allocated from the Foundation to successful projects/code enhancements.
 
建议通过对MaidSafe开发者邮件列表进行投票来选择代码提交和第三方项目，并且将从基金会分配付款给成功的项目/代码增强。
 
The mining speed per vault is *projected* as:  每个时段的采矿速度 *预计* 为：

| 时段 | 币数 |
| -------------|:---------------:|
|first day	| 800 |
|first week | 1800 |
|first month |	4000 |
|first year |	19000 |

The size of the seeding network is estimated to be around 2,000 vaults, that being the case it is projected that the first month income will be around 8M coins and 38M in total during the first year.

播种网络的规模估计约为2000个保管库，预计第一个月的收入将在800万左右，总计38M左右。

Third party developers will also be incentivised outside of the token scheme.  Choosing to develop their applications and businesses on the SAFE network will, when the network reaches critical mass, enable them to outperform all incumbents, while providing privacy and security to all their users.  The network code is free to use and there are no upfront charges for API keys or developer programmes.  Developers’ customer acquisition costs will be a fraction of the levels compared to traditional architecture due to the lack of infrastructure costs.

第三方开发商也会在token计划之外获得激励。 选择在SAFE网络上开发他们的应用程序和业务时，当网络达到临界值时，使他们能够胜过所有在位者，同时为所有用户提供隐私和安全。 网络代码可以免费使用，API密钥或开发人员程序不需要预付费用。 由于缺乏基础设施成本，与传统架构相比，开发人员的客户购置成本仅为水平的一小部分。

#### 7. SAFE Crowd Sale SAFE人群出售

The crowd sale will be operated as follows:

人群出售将按以下方式进行：

* A fixed number of MaidSafeCoin will be issued during the crowd sale
* The sale will last until all coins have been purchased (circa $8million) or 30 days has passed, whatever happens first
* Within that period, public funds in the form of bitcoin and mastercoin can be sent to exodus bitcoin address via www.BuySafeCoins.com
* Each participant will purchase an intermediary coin, MaidSafeCoin
* A quantity of 429,496,729 coins will be available for purchase, this equates to 10% of all safecoins
* Early buyer incentives are in place to reward early participation (see chart below)
* It is estimated that participants will purchase 17,000 MaidSafeCoins for 1 bitcoin
* All purchases and transctions will be recorded on the Bitcoin block chain via the Mastercoin protocol
* The deposit of funds in the exodus address will auto generate the appropriate level of MaidSafeCoins, they will be reciepted in the participants mastercoin wallet
* Once the full network is launched these will be traded on a 1:1 basis for safecoin    
* Each participants safecoin wallet will be credited as the full network is launched and they create their SAFE network accounts 
* In the event that not all coins are sold, the remaining coins will be burned
* All details are available at www.safecoin.io
>
* 人群出售期间将发放固定数量的MaidSafeCoin
* 出售将持续到所有币已被购买（大约800万美元）或30天过去，无论先发生什么
* 在此期间，比特币和mastercoin形式的公共资金可以通过www.BuySafeCoins.com发送到exodus比特币地址
* 每个参与者将购买一个中介币MaidSafeCoin
* 可购买数量为429,496,729的币，相当于所有SafeCoin的10％
* 早期购买者奖励措施已经到位，以奖励早期参与（见下图）
* 估计参与者将为1比特币购买17,000个MaidSafeCoins
* 所有采购和交易将通过Mastercoin协议记录在比特币区块链中
* 在exodus地址存款将自动产生适当水平的MaidSafeCoins，他们将被收入参与者Mastercoin钱包
* 一旦完整的网络推出，这些交易将以1：1的比例进行交易
* 每个参与者的SafeCoin钱包将在整个网络启动时记入贷方，并创建他们的SAFE网络帐户
* 如果并非所有币都已售出，剩余的币将被烧毁
* 所有的细节都可以在www.safecoin.io上找到

**Early buyer incentive** **早期买家奖励**

| Time | % Bonus |
| -------------|:---------------:|
|week 1	| 40% |
|week 2 | 30% |
|week 3 | 20% |
|week 4 | 10% |

**After this stage is complete there will be no further opportunities of this sort available on the SAFE network with safecoin.**

**这一阶段完成后，SAFE网络上将不再有机会使用safecoin。**

The incentivisation of decentralised application projects that are funded via safecoin should also ensure a very active participation into a very powerful ecosystem with a pre-prepared revenue model.  It is also thought this model will encourage a more decentralised and distributed pool of backers.  This model is very much in line with MaidSafe’s core values and decentralisation in general, using logic and fairness with as few ‘magic’ numbers as possible. 

对通过SafeCoin进行资助的分散型应用项目的激励也应该确保用预先准备好的收入模式非常积极地参与一个非常强大的生态系统。 也有人认为这种模式会鼓励更分散和分散的支持者群。 这个模型非常符合MaidSafe的核心价值观和分权化，通过尽可能少的'魔术'数字来使用逻辑和公平。

It is interesting to note this crowd sale does not hold any safecoins for the founders; **no founders’ pool is involved.**  MaidSafe will work with the funds raised and commit to continue to develop the internal library code to earn coins in the future, provided the code is accepted by the community (as per the acceptance criteria agreed on at that time by the mailing list participants and Foundation board).  It is also the founders’ belief that if MaidSafe or any other group do not continue to innovate, they should not continue to strive as businesses.  This allows the community to always be presented with the most efficient code and advancements to the system regardless of which entity makes those advances possible.

有意思的是，这次出售人群并没有为创始人提供任何SafeCoin; **未涉及创始人池** MaidSafe将与筹集的资金一起工作，并承诺继续开发内部图书馆代码以便将来赚取币，前提是代码被社区接受（根据约定的验收标准 当时由邮件列表参与者和基金会董事会）。 创始人还认为，如果MaidSafe或其他任何组织不能继续创新，他们就不应该继续为企业而努力。 这样，无论哪个实体可以使这些进步成为可能，这个社区总能得到最有效的代码和系统进步。

In this manner, **MaidSafe will ‘eat at the same table’ as all other developers in the SAFE network** and all application providers that will earn revenues via the safecoin model.  It is envisaged that this approach is a very fresh and healthy model with the appropriate levels of risk and reward for all stakeholders.

通过这种方式，**MaidSafe将与SAFE网络中的所有其他开发商** 和所有将通过Safecoin模式获得收益的应用程序提供商“在同一餐桌吃饭”。 设想这种方法是一个非常新鲜和健康的模式，对所有利益相关者都有适当的风险和回报水平。
 
#### 8. MaidSafe基金会  

The MaidSafe Foundation will initially:

MaidSafe基金会最初将：

* Hold and distribute safecoin for developer pools
* Manage issuance of MaidSafeCoin to funders and existing investors
* Hold all patents and use safecoin to pay for the upkeep and further patents for all projects (until this sphere cannot be litigated against, the MaidSafe Foundation will act as the holder of defensive patents, of which there is already a considerable worldwide portfolio, to protect the decentralised Internet).
* House the MaidSafe team in an HQ and provide funding for independent development pods, worldwide 
* Provide finances for the core team and development pods for a period of at least three years (we have already started discussions with a person in San Francisco to begin this process immediately on funding, we hope to have at least six such pods, worldwide in year one)

* 为开发人员池保留并分发Safecoin
* 管理MaidSafeCoin向资助者和现有投资者的发行
* 持有所有专利并使用Safecoin支付所有项目的保养和进一步专利（在这个领域无法起诉的情况下，MaidSafe基金会将充当防御性专利的持有者，其中已经有相当多的全球投资组合） 保护分散的互联网）。
* 将MaidSafe团队安置在总部，并为全球独立开发模块提供资金
* 为核心团队和开发团队提供至少三年的财务支持（我们已经开始与旧金山的一位人士进行讨论，立即就资金开始这一过程，我们希望至少在全球范围内拥有六个此类团队 第一年）

No further actions can be taken by the Foundation, unless the authority is requested by the community to add additional objectives to this list.

基金会不能采取进一步的行动，除非社区要求当局在这份清单中增加额外的目标。

Board members will be appointed from the community via polling.  This board should be selected from as wide a catchment as possible and include 3rd party developers, core developers and members of other decentralised projects (e.g. Mastercoin, Invictus).  The board members will be continually up for election.  If the polling shows the community wish a member to be removed then the next meeting will remove that person and they should be replaced by the next in line, selected again via polls. 

董事会成员将通过投票从社区任命。 该董事会应尽可能从广泛的流派中挑选出来，包括第三方开发人员，核心开发人员和其他分散项目成员（例如Mastercoin，Invictus）。 董事会成员将继续参选。 如果投票显示社群希望成员被移除，那么下一次会议将移除该人，并且他们应该被下一个在线排队取代，并通过民意调查再次选中。

This group will ensure the correctness of the coin issuance and also that every project that is applicable is included in the polling system for funding of that project.  The board can put forward their suggestions and conclusions for any funding for projects.  The assurance of developer rewards will also be continuously-monitored and managed.  This mandate will be kept as minimal as possible to prevent unfair or ill considered decision making.

该小组将确保发行币的正确性，并确保每个适用的项目都包含在投票系统中，以资助该项目。 董事会可以为任何项目资金提出建议和结论。 开发者奖励的保证也将被持续监控和管理。 这项任务将尽可能减少，以防止不公平或不适当的决策。

An early project on the network will be a decentralised digital voting system.  This system will be used to select and continually manage a member’s position on the board.

网络上的早期项目将是一个分散式数字投票系统。 该系统将用于选择并持续管理董事会成员的职位。

## SAFE网络上的Token系统  ##
版本 1.3

最后更新2014年3月26日

#### 1.	介绍
The SAFE network [ref Network] utilises a mathematically complete, peer-to-peer Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) authorisation on an autonomous network [ref Autonomous], secured key-value storage and reliable Kademlia based routing [ref Routing]. The network is designed to be decentralised and has the ability to get rid of Domain Name System (DNS). The PKI solution deployed within the SAFE network validates a user’s identity with mathematical certainty.

SAFE网络[ref Network]利用自治网络[参考自治]上的数学上完整的对等公钥基础设施（PKI）授权，安全的密钥值存储和基于可靠Kademlia路由[参考路由]。 该网络旨在分散管理，并有能力摆脱域名系统（DNS）。 部署在SAFE网络内的PKI解决方案以数学确定性验证用户的身份。

Bitcoin [ref BitCoin] has proved the ability of crypto currencies to disrupt the status quo.  Bitcoin proposed and executed a very innovative idea, coupled with a well-considered system design based on the block-chain and proof-of-work concepts. In essence, Bitcoin is a partially-decentralised (due to the use of the block chain) digital currency on a centralised network. MaidSafe propose a token based economic system on the SAFE network. In effect, a decentralised digital currency system on decentralised network. 

比特币[ref BitCoin]已经证明了加密货币破坏现状的能力。 比特币提出并执行了一个非常创新的想法，加上基于块链和工作证明概念的考虑周全的系统设计。 实质上，比特币是集中式网络上的部分分散（由于使用区块链）数字货币。 MaidSafe在SAFE网络上提出一个基于Token的经济系统。 实际上，分散式网络上的分散数字货币系统。
 
#### 2.	可信组
With the SAFE network, it can be assumed that the majority of a close group of nodes is trustable. While not impossible to generate a majority of malicious nodes in a close group around a particular target, it should be considered computationally unfeasible.

通过SAFE网络，可以假设大多数紧密的节点组是可信的。 虽然并非不可能在围绕特定目标的关闭组中生成大多数恶意节点，但应将其视为计算上不可行的。

On the SAFE network, the following rules ensure a trusted group:

在SAFE网络上，以下规则确保可信组：

* It is hard to have a vault with a particular address (the address of a new vault will be defined by the network using the hash of the vault’s credentials). In addition, each time a vault is switched off and then rejoins the network, it will be assigned a new address. Furthermore, the node will not be considered a full functional vault until the verification period is complete.
* When a request is emitted from a group, all group member’s signatures will be attached. On the receiver side, a routing level find closest verification will be carried out to verify the senders are really closest nodes to the target. In addition, the public keys for the nodes will be downloaded from the network to validate signatures.
* The close group is not formed in a deterministic way (i.e. based on XOR distance as defined by Kademlia only). The close group of a target will only be formed when the target goes to the network. Unless the target is pre-known, it cannot tell whether two nodes are close.
* For sensitive data like currency or transaction, there is an additional level of protection : chained group. Chained group means the target is not only handled by the group around it, but also is managed by the other group chained to the target. The chain is established in a determistic way once the target is known, which allows verfication by public.
* The exchange of a vault between different users is not allowed. It is possible for a vault not to be linked to an account (unowned) and then linked to an account later (owned). However, once linked that vault cannot be detached.

* 具有特定地址的保险库很难（新保管库的地址将由网络使用保管库凭证的散列来定义）。另外，每次关闭电子仓库并重新加入网络时，都会分配一个新地址。此外，在验证期结束之前，节点将不被视为全功能库。
* 当一个组发出请求时，将附加所有组成员的签名。在接收端，路由级别发现最接近的验证将被执行以验证发送者是否与目标真正最接近的节点。另外，节点的公钥将从网络下载以验证签名。
* 关闭组不是以确定性方式形成的（即仅基于Kademlia定义的异或距离）。只有当目标进入网络时才会形成目标的关闭组。除非目标是预先知道的，否则它不能分辨两个节点是否接近。
* 对于诸如货币或交易等敏感数据，还有一个额外的保护级别：链接组。链接组意味着目标不仅由其周围的组处理，而且还由与目标链接的其他组管理。一旦目标已知，链条就会以一种确定的方式建立起来，这就允许公众进行确认。
* 不允许在不同用户之间交换保险库。保险柜可能无法链接到一个帐户（无主），然后链接到一个帐户以后（拥有）。但是，一旦连接，该保险库不能分离。

Furthermore, there is the RUDP [ref RUDP] layer which encrypts communications between nodes to prevent the message content from being secretly modified by a third party. This ensures the request reflects the real intention of the sender.

此外，RUDP [ref RUDP]层对节点之间的通信进行加密，以防止消息内容被第三方秘密修改。 这确保了请求反映了发件人的真实意图。

Once the majority of the nodes inside the group have sent out a consistent request, it shall be considered valid.

一旦组内大多数节点发出了一致的请求，它就应该被认为是有效的。

Once the majority of the nodes have decided to perform the same action, the action shall be considered valid.

一旦大多数节点决定执行相同的动作，则该动作应被视为有效。

The Trusted Group feature, delivered by the SAFE network, ensures the system is secure as long as the majority of the nodes are honest and it is computationally / economically expensive to form a malicious node.

由SAFE网络提供的可信组功能确保了系统的安全，只要大多数节点是诚实的，并且形成恶意节点在计算上/经济上是昂贵的。


#### 3.	转移机制
On the SAFE network, vaults assume various personas or roles [ref Persona], depending on the requests they receive.  For example, the DataManager persona is responsible for managing the integrity and availability of a given piece of data on the network.  A separate persona, the TransactionManager, is proposed to handle all the token-related transactions.  A TransactionManager group will be a trusted group of nodes which are closest to any given transaction identity. The TransactionManager is responsible for the logic that enables transactions to be completed.

在SAFE网络上，保管库根据他们收到的请求承担各种人物角色或角色[ref Persona]。例如，DataManager角色负责管理网络上给定数据的完整性和可用性。一个单独的角色TransactionManager被提出来处理所有与Token相关的事务。一个TransactionManager组将是一个可信任的最接近任何给定事务标识的节点组。 TransactionManager负责使事务完成的逻辑。

The transfer mechanism is defined as: ‘allowing a transaction (transfer of credit from A's wallet to B's wallet) between two user's persona groups to be completed’. The transaction shall be open and read only to public (allowing an upper layer third party broker app to validate there is transaction happening/completed).

转账机制被定义为：'允许两个用户的角色组之间的交易（从A的钱包到B的钱包的转账）“。交易应公开并只能公开阅读（允许上层第三方经纪人应用程序验证交易是否发生/完成）。

The SAFE wallet is defined as : the place holding the credits (and the credit change history) for an account.

SAFE钱包定义为：持有账户信用（和信用变更历史）的地方。

The procedure of a transfer (user_A transfers credit to user_B) can be illustrated as :

1.	User A makes a function call : user_A.Transfer(user_B, amount, wallet)
2.	When the Maid Manager group of user A receives a request, they :
    
    i)    debit the amount from user A's wallet
    
    ii)   send a request to the TransactionManager
    
    iii)  send a notification to the upper layer API
3.	When the Transaction Manager group receives a notification, they :

    i)    send a notification to user B's persona

    ii)   create an internal transaction
4.	When user B's Maid Manager group receives a valid notification they :

    i)    send an acknowledgement to the TransactionManager group

    ii)   credit user B's wallet with the amount

转账程序（用户_A将信用转账给用户_B）可以表示为：

1.用户A进行函数调用：user_A.Transfer（user_B，amount，wallet）

2.当用户A的Maid管理员组收到请求时，他们：
    
     i) 从用户A的钱包中扣除金额
    
     ii) 向TransactionManager发送请求
    
     iii) 向上层API发送通知

3.当事务管理器组收到通知时，他们会：

     i)向用户B的角色发送通知

     ii) 创建内部交易

4.当用户B的Maid管理员组收到有效的通知时，他们会：

     i) 向TransactionManager组发送确认

     ii) 信用户B的钱包与金额

#### 4.	资源证明
On the SAFE network, a user contributes to the network by running a vault, which will handle requests and store data for others. The following parameters are used to measure a vault and a user account:

在SAFE网络上，用户通过运行保管库来为网络作出贡献，该保管库将处理请求并为其他人存储数据。 以下参数用于衡量保险库和用户帐户：

* stored_space: the total size of chunks that have been stored to that vault by the network

* lost_data: as data is stored on a node it may switch off or be otherwise unavailable, we consider this to be lost data. This is a critically important measure and in no way means the network has actually lost data as replicant copies are always available. This is a common practice for a node on the network.

* healthy_space (h.s.) :  h.s. = stored_space - lost_data    ------   ①

* available_space: the storage space a vault claimed (via the user) it can contribute to the network

* data_cost: data_cost will be calculated as the data_size that user stored to network. It will be refunded once user deletes the stored data. The client application has a local level deduplication, which will prevent a user from being charged twice when storing the same data again to the network.

* used_space: total data_cost of all the chunks that user put to network

The Proof Of Resource (P.O.R) is derived from healthy_space (which is a kind of QoS measurement)

* P.O.R will be updated when healthy_space updated in bi-direction

Δ P.O.R =  Δ healthy_space       ------   ②

This ensures P.O.R becomes a huge negative when the user transfers out P.O.R and then switches off their vault

* P.O.R will be checked when a user tries to PUT data.
(used_space + data_cost ) < P.O.R      ------   ③

A user’s initial allowance will be granted by setting used_space to negative claimed available_space. If any cheating is detected, the used_space will be changed to reflect that.

This will also cover for situations when a user’s P.O.R drops by allowing the user to mutate his free allowance data.

* P.O.R is transferable among users

* P.O.R shall be an int in a unit directly derived from size unit KB (MB ...)

* The Maid Account will be the wallet of the P.O.R, and the Maid Manager group will be responsible for 
processing any updates.

* P.O.R shall be considered as a standard unit being recognized by all nodes across the SAFE network.

| User A |   | | User B |  |  | 
| ---------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| Action | (used_space, stored_space, P.O.R)  | Allowance | Action | (used_space, stored_space, P.O.R)  | Allowance | 
|Create Account	| (0, 0, 0) | 0 |Create Account	| (0, 0, 0) | 0 |
| Picked by Network To store 50 data	| (0, 50, 50) | 50 | Never picked up or don’t have a Vault | (0, 0, 0) | 0 |
|Store 20 data to network	| (20, 50, 50) | 30 | Nothing Done | (0, 0, 0) | 0 |
|Sell 20 P.O.R to User B	| (20, 50, 30) | 10 | Buy 20 P.O.R from User A | (0, 0, 20) | 20 |
|stored_space decreased by 10. Q.O.S drop or stored chunk removed by network | (20, 40, 20) | 0 | Store 10 data and get picked to store 10 | (10, 10, 30) | 20 |

#### 5.	Economic System With Two Types Of Token 两种Token的经济系统

P.O.R is proposed in order to facilitate the exchange of storage space on the SAFE network. However, as it doesn't have a predictable cap number, it may not be considered a genuine virtual currency. To provide a more robust form of exchange, MaidSafe proposes a token system that is totally independent of P.O.R, called safecoin. Safecoin will have a predicatable cap and will be injected into network using the storage space related mining procedure.

P.O.R是为了便于在SAFE网络上交换存储空间而提出的。但是，由于它没有可预测的上限数量，因此它可能不被视为真正的虚拟货币。为了提供更强大的交换形式，MaidSafe提出了一个完全独立于P.O.R的称为SafeCoin的Token系统。 Safecoin将具有可预测的上限，并将使用与存储空间相关的挖掘程序注入网络。

A bridge (converting rate) between P.O.R and safecoin can be established by the market solely. With third party upper layer broker applications, it will be possible to use safecoin to buy P.O.R or vice versa (user_A gives safecoin to user_B in exchange for user_B's P.O.R). It is expected that the per unit value of P.O.R will keep decreasing, while the per unit value of safecoin will continue to rise. In this way, it will be possible to buy more and more P.O.R with one safecoin. Safecoin will only be stored in the Maid Account wallet, this can only be updated by the Maid Manager group.

P.O.R和safecoin之间的桥（转换率）可以由市场单独建立。通过第三方上层经纪人应用程序，可以使用Safecoin购买P.O.R或反之（用户_A向用户_B提供Safecoin以换取user_B的P.O.R）。预计P.O.R的单位价值将继续下降，而Safecoin的单位价值将继续上涨。通过这种方式，可以用一个保险箱来购买越来越多的P.O.R。 Safecoin只会存储在Maid账户钱包中，这只能由Maid经理组更新。

The value one safecoin represents will be recognised by all peers across the network and outside the network. If the economic system works as intended, safecoin will become a ‘virtual currency’ with the SAFE network being used to complete all transactions. Meanwhile, P.O.R will solely be used for exchanging space allowance among users.

Safecoin所代表的价值将被网络内外的所有同行认可。如果经济体系按预期运作，safecoin将成为“虚拟货币”，SAFE网络将用于完成所有交易。同时，P.O.R将仅用于在用户间交换空间补贴。

A projection of P.O.R. is estimated as :

P.O.R.的预测 估计为：

| Network Wide Total Data | Copies | Traffic | De-Duplication Factor | P.O.R | Nodes | Data Put per Node | P.O.R per Node |
| ---------------|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|:-----------------:|
| 1000 | 4 | 1 | 1 | 5000 | 100 | 10 | 50|
| 3800 | 4 | 0.9 | 0.9 | 17100 | 200 | 19 | 85.5 |
| 10800 | 4 | 0.8 | 0.8 | 43200 | 400 | 27 | 108 |
| 27200 | 4 | 0.7 | 0.7 | 95200 | 800 | 34 | 119 |
| 64000 | 4 | 0.6 | 0.6 | 192000 | 1600 | 40 | 120 |
| 144000 | 4 | 0.5 | 0.5 | 360000 | 3200 | 45 | 112.5 |
| 313600 | 4 | 0.4 | 0.4 | 627200 | 6400 | 49 | 98 |
| 665600 | 4 | 0.3 | 0.3 | 998400 | 12800 | 52 | 78 |
| 1382400 | 4 | 0.2 | 0.2 | 1382400 | 25600 | 54 | 54 |


#### 6.	Safecoin数据结构
Safecoin issuance will be capped at 2^32 (4.3 billion). Unlike P.O.R, which is just an integer number held in the  Maid Account, each safecoin is represented by a special token type data. The data structure of such can be illustrated as :

Safecoin的发行上限为 2^32（43亿美元）。 与P.O.R不同，P.O.R只是Maid账户中的一个整数，每个Safecoin由一个特殊的Token类型数据表示。 这样的数据结构可以表示为：

| Field | Content |
| ---------------|:-----------------:|
|Name | See below |
|Prev Owner | previous_owner |
|Curr Owner | Sign(current_owner, version_number)<sub>previous_owner</sub> |
| Escrows | Sign(escrow_1, ..., escrow_n)<sub>previous_owner</sub> |
| Escrow 1 | Sign(owner)<sub>escrow_1</sub> |
| ... | ... |
| Escrow n | Sign(owner)<sub>escrow_n</sub> |

The name of a safecoin is 64 bytes long to allow it to be a network-addressable object. However, the name has a particular format:

[ 32 bits: Token ID    |   224 bits: ID padding   |   x bits (x <= 248): Subdivision bits   |   248 - x: Random   |   8 bits: Value of x ]

The initial part (Token ID) inherently limits the total number of tokens available to 2^32 since each token must have a unique ID.

The second part (ID padding) must be predictable (e.g. it could just be all ‘0’s, or it could be the ID concatenated 7 times).  Its purpose is to force all subdivisions of a given coin token the same trusted group of vaults to eliminate the need for network traffic when handling such subdivisions.

The third part defines the subdivision name. For example, if x == 1 (regardless of whether the value of that bit is 0 or 1) then that token represents a half of the original token.

The fourth part is random padding.

The fifth part indicates the level of subdivision of the original token, i.e. it contains the value of x.

This format allows the tokens to be split into 2<sup>248</sup> parts if required. The splitting process will only allow the token (or subdivided token) to be bisected, so e.g. quartering a token would need to be done in 2 steps. When splitting a token, only the name changes; all other parts are copied to the new subdivisions. The split results in 2 tokens, each representing a half of the original token value. This procedure is further illustrated in the following diagram.

![Diagram Split Safecoin](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maidsafe/Whitepapers/master/resources/split_safecoin_diagram.png)

The current_owner, together with the current version number, needs to be signed by the previous_owner, allowing a third party verification.

Escrows have the right to block / enable the access to the token by voting with majority (fill the correspondent excrow field with approved owner). i.e. only the majority of escrow approved owner will be allowed to update the token data.

This special safecoin data is being distributed by the DataManager and held in PmidManager's memory (shall never be stored to PmidNode as a chunk).

#### 7.	Safecoin Requests / Persona Roles

Safecoin data is one kind of data, so it has PUT and GET request being defined. However, unlike normal data, there is no DELETE request defined for it. The PUT request for safecoin is "no duplication allowed", i.e. if there is already a safecoin data having same name (first 32 bits), the new put request shall be rejected. This will be handled by the DataManager receiving the request.

A new request, EXCHANGE, is defined to allow approved requester update the pay_load of the token data. The rules defined as :
* Only the owner that be approved by the majority of escrows and owners (previous / current owners considered as approved themselves) can update all fields.
* Each escrow can only update their correspondent field once
* Each time prev / curr owner field get updated, the version_number must be increased by 1 step, and all escrow fields shall be erased

The above rules will be enforced by the PmidManager holding the safecoin data. As the ownership field, together with the escrow fields, are used as a 'transaction', the PmidManager effectively becomes the TransactionManager. In this instance, the safecoin data can also be considered as a receipt object as well.

The safecoin data also served as "wallet" to itself, i.e. a wallet that holds one token only. A user level bookkeeper, holding the list of token one user owns, can be completed as a client only application. That list of token information can be stored in user's local machine or uploaded to the network as encrypted data.


#### 8.	Safecoin Transaction Structure / Scenarios
The following diagram illustrates the evolve of RPC requests and safecoin data structure during a transaction process. It has the capability to support multiple escrows model (like multi-signature [ref Escrow] [ref BIP16/17] proposed for Bitcoin).

The following table illustrates the evolve of user account holding safecoins info, together with the safecoin data held by PmidManager.

#### 9.	Mining Safecoin
Every mining interval, the Pmid Manager group around a vault will perform the mining for that vault. The Pmid Manager will generate a Random Attempt Target (R.A.T) based on the following calculation:

R.A.T = Sign(Hash( (merkle_tree_root + msg_id) XOR R.A.T prev ))<sub>PmidManagerGroup</sub>    ------   ④

where : merkle_tree_root is generated from all the chunks stored on that vault

msg_id is the agreed random ID among the Pmid Manager group.

Sign()<sub>PmidManagerGroup</sub> means the PmidManager group in charge shall sign the hashed result. This makes RAT as proof of mining, allowing other vaults to verify.

The R.A.T will then be sent to the Data Manager as a PUT request, claiming the ownership of that token on behalf of that vault. If DataManager has no record of a token data bearing same token_index (first 32 bits), the token data will be passed to PmidManager to be held, and the correspodent MaidManager will be notified of the success. Otherwise, the request will be muted.

The mining interval allowed for a vault is determined by its contribution to the network. The interval is calculated as follows:
  
for each put attempts to the vault, when healthy_space is greater than group_average / 2 :

MessageID % (24 - round(log<sub>2</sub>(healthy_space / 1MB))) == 0 ? true : false  ------    ⑤

where : group_average is average healthy_space among the close group the vault belongs to

MessageID is the message_id from the put attempt request

This caps the quickest mining speed at one mining attempt per put attempt and set the slowest to be one mining attempt per 24 put attempts.


Given the collision probability against the accumulated number of attempts as shown in the following table. Where N is the total space (which is 4.3 billion in our case as the issuance of safecoin is capped at 2<sup>32</sup>).

| Collision Probability | Num of Attempts |
| ---------------|:-----------------:|
| 10% | 0.105 N |
| 20% | 0.22 N |
| 30% | 0.36 N |
| 40% | 0.51 N |
| 50% | 0.69 N |
| 60% | 0.92 N |
| 70% | 1.2 N |
| 80% | 1.6 N |
| 90% | 2.3 N |
| 95% | 3 N |

#### 10.	Day 1 Injection
To reward investors and developers involved during the early stages of this project, it is 
proposed that 30% of all safecoins will be injected into the network on day 1. Up to 10% will be available for purchase via the crowd sale, 5% for the existing MaidSafe investors, 5% for the SAFE core development team and 10% for the general developer pool.

This 10% safecoin will require a storage space of 1TB, given the average SDV size is estimated to be 0.5kB. Vaults holding these SDV will gain P.O.R, which means the same amount of P.O.R is also injected into network. This ensures there is certain amount of P.O.R available across the network for those client only users to startup with. This may be P.O.R given as gift or purchased from other users. As pointed out in the (table POR projection), sufficient P.O.R will be generated via user behaviour during the early stages, it is expected this initial injection will be enough to kick start the provision of storage to the public. 

#### 11.	Summary
To conclude, MaidSafe proposed the SAFE network, an economic system that contains two types of token and relies on a trusted group. The transfer mechanism is advantageous in many respects and has the functionality to prevent double-spending, while enabling the verification of transactions immediately. Transaction Managers handling SDV data type are included into the SAFE network to manage tokens and transactions. Proof of Resource (P.O.R) is introduced to smooth the exchange of storage space, while safecoin is introduced to incentivise stakeholders throughout the network. The total cap of safecoin is set to be 4.3 billion. With the proposed mining procedure (and assumptions) it is estimated that half the total volume will issued during the first 5 years, with 95% issued after 10 years. End users will mine coins based on their ability to provide computing resources to the network and, in addition to the other benefits offered by SAFE, this will be their main incentive for contributing storage space. The tech stack of the token system is illustrated as <diagram Tech Stack>.
